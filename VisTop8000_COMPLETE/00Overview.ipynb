    "The overarching goal of this workshop is to introduce you to running **Python** in **Jupyter notebooks** and using **biopython** to extract and visualize information from PDB files. This workshop is broken down into three Jupyter notebooks delinated below. This is by no means intended to make you procient in writing your own code, but it rather intended as a chance for you to get comfortable with Jupyter notebooks and to run Python code to visualize protein data.\n",

In this activity, we will using the above mentioned tools to examine trends in the protein structures. Because extracting information from this dataset often takes 1-20 minutes per calculation, we will use a **random subset of 80 protein structures** for this activity to avoid exessively long waits. The full dataset is no longer available on the web and has been replaced by the top2018 dataset.\n",
